# chrome_genetic_experiment
an example for genetic algorithm

[Launch experiment](https://ajay-sreeram.github.io/chrome_genetic_experiment/)

steps to run the application:

                 *  open index.html with chrome
		 * just look at the movements of ants, after some time most of the ants will start moving the target

	         * again wait for some time, after which you can see most of the ants starts moving towards target
